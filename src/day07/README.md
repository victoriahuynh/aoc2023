## Notes

- i kept getting tripped up on silly mistakes otherwise i would've been faster (i swear)
- like i forgot to return the two pair value 
- and i accidentally forgot to assign the new joker card rankings in part 2 and was using the original rankings like "huh why isn't this sorting properly"
- i was struggling real bad on part 2 until i realized you should apply the jokers to the card value that appears most frequently in the hand!!
