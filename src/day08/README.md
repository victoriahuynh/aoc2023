## Notes

ummmm this was very strongly a learning day vs me getting it totally myself day. 
tbh at first i thought there were like BST or graph traversal shenanigans going on and i was going to not even try bc i haven't done any of that since my college algos/leetcode day
also I have never done a LCM ?? problem before and I didn't even know that was like the GO TO solution for part 2 for everyone else until I peeked online. like damn ok
